# Work Day Schedule
<h2>Module 5 Challenge: Third Party APIs</h2>

For this week's challenge, I created a simple calender application using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

The purpose of this application was to create a simple calender for users to enter events into a color-code work schedule. The schedule has color-coded time blocks between 9am-5pm and allow users to enter deadlines, meetings, or other events into the schedule and save onto local storage. 

The requirements for the assignment are listed below:

- When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender.

- When I scroll the page, I am presented with time blocks for that day (9am - 5pm).

- When I view the time blocks each day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

- When I click into a time block, I can enter an event.

- When I click save for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.

- When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
